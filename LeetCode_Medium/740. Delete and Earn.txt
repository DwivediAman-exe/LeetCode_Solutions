You are given an integer array nums. You want to maximize the number of points you get by performing the following operation any number of times:
Pick any nums[i] and delete it to earn nums[i] points. Afterwards, you must delete every element equal to nums[i] - 1 and every element equal to nums[i] + 1.
Return the maximum number of points you can earn by applying the above operation some number of times.

Input: nums = [3,4,2]
Output: 6
Explanation: You can perform the following operations:
- Delete 4 to earn 4 points. Consequently, 3 is also deleted. nums = [2].
- Delete 2 to earn 2 points. nums = [].
You earn a total of 6 points.

Method 1: DP
TC - O(N) SC - O(N)

class Solution {
public:
    int deleteAndEarn(vector<int>& nums) {
        vector<int>freq(20005);
        for(auto x: nums)
            freq[x]++;
        
        int max_ele = *max_element(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        int dp[20005];
        dp[1] = freq[1];
        dp[2] = max(freq[2]*2, dp[1]);
        for(int i=3;i<=max_ele;i++)
            dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2]+freq[i]*i);
        
        return dp[max_ele];
    }
};
